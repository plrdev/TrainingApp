4. 1 Add third party library that uses native features

- React-native-device-info, react-native-camera..
- Use the library
- #Bonus Check from the source code how the native module is added (both iOS and Android!)

4.2 Create your own native module

- Use your imagination â€“ what could the native side do?
- Minimum - Return a value from it to the JS side and display it
Hint: https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro documents well these parts
- Remember to do both iOS (on mac) and Android!
